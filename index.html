		<p>Despite what slanted anti-patriotic documentaries out there say -
		Burger Shot is a shining emblem of the American way, the American
		meal, and the American lifestyle. Stop in to Burger Shot, because
		everybody likes to get their stinking meat between two dripping
		moist buns! There is no smell quite like the moment you walk into
		Burger Shot. Burning fat, decomposing flesh, day-old diarrhea,
		rotting vegetables, baby vomit, hobo sweat and crack smoke all
		blend together to form the delicious, unmistakable aroma of
		America's favorite national quick service restaurant chain. Burger
		Shot is a symbol of hope for children around the world. Children in
		Nigeria see us all bubbling out of our trousers, doing our part in the
		national obesity epidemic and get so upset that they take out their
		anger by sending spam emails.</p>

		<p>You see, BS is a beacon at the head of the relentless march towards
		cultural homogenization - a little something we call progress. Over
		the past 50 years, we have perfected the standardization of eating
		environments that are impossible to relax in. It would not be Burger
		Shot without the uncomfortable plastic seats, bright lighting and
		mirrors that make you look like you have just come out of a meth
		binge. We feed 50% of Americans every day and own more land than
		all religious institutions combined. Everybody loves the flame-burnt,
		painted-on flavor of Burger Shot. A 48-hour aftertaste is a small
		price to pay when you can feed the whole family for $3. Our food is
		cheap in the short term and costly in the long term. Just like our
		economic policies. Great</p>
