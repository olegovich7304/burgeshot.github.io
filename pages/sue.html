		<p>Let us break this down for you if you consume more calories than
		you can burn off, you put on weight. You are fat because you have no
		self-control, fat-ass. Nobody said that you are supposed to eat it
		every day! Oh wait, we did! If you spent the last five years eating all
		your meals at Burger Shot and now weigh 400 pounds, don't try to
		throw it back in our face. Why aren't all the drunks suing Wife Beater
		gin or Jakey's lager? Do you want us to start saying to customers, "I
		think that you've had enough fries for one day, buddy." You have all
		had it too easy for too long. When your idea of a workout is trying to
		tip your burger tray into an over-sized trashcan without the lid
		flapping shut and covering you in gherkin mulch, you probably need to
		take a look at your lifestyle choices. Why do you think that we
		stopped filling your drinks for you? Why do you think that we now
		throw an empty cup in your face and scowl in the direction of a
		disease-ridden soda dispenser? Get some exercise! Enough of the
		'Burger Shot made me fat' lawsuits! You will never win - we have
		more litigators than you have had fresh vegetables.</p>
		<p>Also, while you are at it:</p>
		<p><span>STOP</span> asking us why we don't serve milkshakes.</p>
		<p><span>STOP</span> jacking off in our restrooms and we might start cleaning them.</p>
		<p><span>STOP</span> telling us how much better the fries are at Wigwam Burger.</p>
		<p><span>STOP</span> asking us when we are going to bring back the Magic
		Mushroom Triple Swiss.</p>
		<p><span>STOP</span> spreading urban myths about battered cysts and rats' heads
		(or at least direct them at Cluckin' Bell).</p>
		<p>Maybe then, and only then, we will stop charging you for extra sauce</p>
