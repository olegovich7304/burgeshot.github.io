		<p>Kids love fast food. And we love kids! Especially ones who pull their
		parents into our stores so they can shove shit down their throats and
		become the type of lazy fuckwad Americans that only care about TV
		and not democracy. We spend billions every year on aggressively
		marketing our products to the tween demographic. The younger our
		customers are, the easier it is to mold their eating preferences for
		life. Our 'Every Child Deserves To Be Loved' TV campaign has been
		very successful in encouraging young people to emotionally
		blackmail their parents into spending money at Burger Shot. Also
		please note that we give away free fries during every Amber Alert.</p>
		<p>Nutritional advice? Take it with a large pinch of salt! Who are you
		going to listen to? Some crusty hippy or sexless crone? Or one of the
		funny, colorful, cuddly mascots that we send to your school? What
		do you care about your diet?! Nobody ever had a stroke at the age of
		10!</p>
		<p>Many of our restaurants have cool playscapes where you will find
		lots of other chubby kids flopping down slides, more germs than a
		campsite toilet and a couple of fully-grown men masturbating behind
		the ball pit.</p>
		<p>Celebrate your birthday at Burger Shot! You never know when it
		might be your last!</p>
		<p>Burger Shot's Birthday Meat Muffin is the perfect treat! A fistful of
		reconstituted cattle off-cuts, the Meat Muffin is frosted with salt and
		comes with fries for candles (note: candle wax is also made from
		beef tallow so you can light them if you want)</p>
