		<p>High school dropouts, crack moms, ex-cons, fine art graduates,
		parolees, YOU! Calling all disadvantaged groups! Take a look at all the
		beautiful, smiling, thin people in our brochure. Work for Burger Shot!
		We will employ you when nobody else will! We even hire people
		rejected by Wigwam Burger. Illiteracy and acne preferred.</p>
		<p>Burger Shot is an equal opportunity employer - we hire lots of
		teenage dropouts. Our restaurants are a great place to learn a
		foreign language, including English. We empower our workers, which
		is why they look so smug when they tell you that "we stopped
		serving breakfast one second ago". The majority of our staff is under
		21, apart from the really old senile people who we like to hire to mop
		up their own urine. All work is part-time and we do not pay overtime.
		Most employees last about three weeks. If you make it past a month,
		we will promote you to Service Expert (no pay raise). We will give
		you some nominal training, like: how to over-salt food so that people
		buy more drinks. After all, we don't want to lose our federal tax
		breaks. However, like a good frat party with a drunk girl, the
		assembly line approach is the key to our success and we have
		broken down the burger-making process into a series of
		mind-numbing repetitive actions. The last thing we want is anyone
		claiming that they are a skilled worker and demanding minimum
		wage or benefits. If you think that this sounds bad, try spending a day
		with our tomato-pickers in Central America.</p>
		<p>If flipping burgers is not your thing, why not work in one of our
		slaughterhouses? Can you imagine slitting throats all day? How many
		other jobs allow you to use a stun gun and skin animals alive? No
		experience necessary</p>
		<p><span>NOTE:</span>Be very careful how you pronounce onion rings. If it sounds
		anything like 'union rings', we will sack you on the spot or put in a call
		to say that you have violated your parole.<br><br>
		<span>Join Burger Shot today!</span></p>
