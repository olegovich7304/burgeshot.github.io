		<p>The Burger Shot Drive-thru is an incredible invention that allows you
		to buy food without leaving the seat of your car. You can also score
		drugs at most of them, if you know the right thing to ask. We started
		installing drive-thrus at our restaurants in the 1980's when we
		realized that customers were increasingly reluctant or unable to
		walk from the parking lot to the counter to get their fix of salt and
		grease. It was a natural follow-up to the TV remote control. Perfect
		for our regulars who can no longer get through the revolving doors</p>
