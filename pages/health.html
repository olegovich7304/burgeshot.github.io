		Ever since the lefties got bored of targeting
		the tobacco industry,Burger Shot has been taking a lot of flak. It's
		pathetic. Do-gooders who we should have killed during the Cold
		War telling us what freedom means? We're patriots, buddy.
		3 Burger Shot.
		Burger S What do you expect for less than a dollar? Chateaubriand? You
		get what you pay for. Our food is cheaper than dog meat!
		Sometimes ignorance is bliss. You don't want to know that your
		sister loves it up the ass and you don't want to know that your
		lunch is made from rancid animal intestines. But you wouldn't
		leave it alone, would you?!!!! So here are the facts:</p>
		<div class="quote">- Your sister really takes it... a lot.</div>
		<div class="quote">- Your sister's friends have always laughed at you and assume you are penile puny.</div>
		<div class="quote">- Most liberals are unsure of their sexual orientation.</div>
		<div class="quote">- 90% of taste comes from smell (kind of disgusting to think what you
		are tasting when the stench of a bum's butt mud hits you on a packed
		subway!). We pay flavor companies in Alderney billions of dollars to
		douse our food in sweet-smelling beef juice. Just like a girl puts on
		make-up, and dumps perfume on her poo-poo-la-la, we brush all our
		burgers with mascara to give them that flame-broiled look after
		they are nuked in the microwave. If we took away the
		chemically-manipulated smell and char-grill paint, you would be left
		with a damp, grey slab of livestock matter that smells like your
		grandmother's crotch.</div>
		<div class="quote">- So much goes into a Burger Shot burger... including cigarette butts,
		used condoms, beer bottles, old newspapers, glue and antifreeze.
		We firmly believe that the life of a diseased animal should not be in
		vain and we make sure that nothing goes to waste: urine, vomit and
		fecal matter all get swept into the meat pit.</div>
		<div class="quote">- We've stopped cooking our fries in lard and have switched to a
		mixture of hydrogenated vegetable oil and beef extract. Ssssh! Don't
		tell the gastronomically ludicrous religious freaks and the
		vegetarians! They have just as much saturated fat but, hey, that is
		better than cholesterol!</div>
		<div class="quote">- You can now get salad. Happy now?! Who goes to a fast food
		restaurant to eat salad? Sorry, but this makes us really angry. So
		angry, in fact, that we decided to load our salad cups with more fat
		than the burgers! Begrudgingly, we will also be adding deep-fried
		broccoli to the menu at the end of the year. Stick that in your artery
		and smoke it.</div>
		<div class="quote">- Our food cannot be that bad. The burgers are 50% water, which is
		supposed to be good for you, and they work their way through your
		system like a tapeworm on speed. They are also great for a
		hangover. They'll give you one five minutes after finishing your meal.</div>
		<div class="quote">- Just to keep you off our back, we are going to start putting very
		conservative estimates of fat and calorie content on the burger
		boxes. This way you can find out at least part of the horrifying truth
		AFTER you have purchased the sandwich. It is then up to you whether
		you eat it, throw it in the trash or save half for the next day (not
		recommended).</div>
