		<h2 class="stretch">MENU</h2>
		<p class="unit">All good beef should be cooked medium-rare. Our burgers are
		served torched on the outside, pink on the inside and buzzing
		with bacteria.</p>
		<div class="free">
			<h5>MEAT FREE MEAL</h5>
			<p class="menu">A veggie burger and fries cooked in animal fat! This is very rarely
			ordered so has normally been sitting on the heated chute for over 48
			hours</p>
		</div>
		<div class="torpedo">
			<h5>THE TORPEDO</h5>
			<p class="menu">Who loves cock?! Who doesn't?! The Torpedo is a deep-fried chicken
			filet on a stale bun. The secret ingredient of our boneless chicken is...
			bones! We throw carrion and carcasses into a tree chipper and grind
			up until we have a paste that tastes like damp sawdust.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="heart">
			<h5>HEART STOPPER 6lb BURGER</h5>
			<p class="menu">Can you imagine a burger as big as your head? Can you imagine
			getting 20 times the recommended daily amounts of calories,
			saturated fat and salt in one sitting? The all new Heartstopper does
			what it says on the box: 7 luke-warm beef patties, cheese, lettuce,
			tomato, half a jar of mayonnaise, pickles and an asylum seeker's
			semen. At 6 lbs, the Heartstopper is like a new-born baby on a roll.
			Die with a smile on your face.</p><br>
			<p class="menu">Amazingly, you will still be hungry again in an hour's time.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="bleeder">
			<h5>THE BLEEDER - ONLY 99Â¢</h5>
			<p class="menu">Two quarter-pound patties, cheese, lettuce and pubic hair for less
			than a dollar! Maximize your meal for another 5 cents! The Bleeder is
			100% animal by-products!</p>

		<h5 class="soon option">COMING SOON:</h5>
		<h5 class="option">THE MERRY MEAL</h5>
		<p>Block your arteries before you even finish high school!
		Meat for minors! The Merry Meal is identical to every other combo
		except it comes with a toy from a labor camp in Southeast Asia!
		Burger Shot has also entered into a partnership with
		<span>Bank of Liberty</span> and, as a special introductory offer, all Merry
		Meals will come with a Kids Kredit Kard for the first six months. A
		$1,000 limit! Ask one of the ex-cons at the register to act as
		co-signer on the application form.</p>
		
		<h5 class="option">KIDDIE FIDDLERS</h5>
		<p>Another option on the Merry Meal Menu, Kiddie Fiddlers are delicious
		deep-fried strips of mysterious dark meat that children will love!
		Feast on grease! Dip your Fiddlers into one of our sickly savory
		syrups: Steaming Hot, Sweet and Squirt, Muddy Mustard or Bubbling
		BBQ.</p>

		<h5 class="slugger">THE BS SLUGGER</h5><!-- --><span class="slugger">- The ultimate break sandwich!</span>
		<p>The Slugger is chicken, beef, sausage, bacon, cheese, syrup, egg and
		cookies served between two hash browns. The only way to start the
		day. It will take you down!</p>
