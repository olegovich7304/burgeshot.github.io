		<p>Come on! Nobody eats at Burger Shot for the service! Most
		employees come into work high or drunk so please don't expect too
		much from them. Don't be surprised if somebody asks you if "you
		want fries with that" when you demand to see the
		post-teenage-pregnancy manager. They really don't care if your
		child "already has that toy". A word of advice: think twice about
		pissing off the people who make your food. An ex-con who has just
		worked a 20-hour shift in a ridiculous burger hat has a very short
		fuse. It only takes a second to sneeze on a bun or spit in the
		ice-cream mix and the last thing you want on your tray is a chewed
		straw or salty mayonnaise.</p>
